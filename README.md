# Introduction
The project is developed for Mapua University - Makati in fulfillment of RES04, Practical Research. This project builds upon the work of a pre-existing project developed by MATLAB, utilizing YOLOv2 as its model. The purpose of this script is to serve as a foundation for gathering results and conducting discussion for the research. We hope that our software will be a valuable resource for those looking to further explore the capabilities of YOLOv2 and its applications in the field of computer vision.
